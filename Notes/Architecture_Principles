Principles :

Reliability -
	1. Test recovery procedures (Diaster recovery)
	2. Automatically recover from failure
	3. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
	4. Frequent automation updates
	
Performance efficiency -
	1. Without provisioning new datacenters, Going live in minutes
	2. Use serverless architecture
	3. Meeting requirements with technology
	
Security - 
	1. Security at all layers
	2. Automating best practices
	3. Protecting data with encryption
	4. Security events (Diaster recovery, Incident response)

Cost Optimization -
	1. Adopting consumption model
	2. Use managed services to reduce cost
	
Operational Excellence - 
	1. Annotated documents
	2. Reversible changes
	3. Anticipating failure
	4. Learning from operational failures
